Remarks
-------

Some people (mostly myself) are asking themselves if I'm ripping off the wonderful: [GitPivotal][1] gem. The answer is most definitely yes. I liked what 
[Jeff Tucker][2] was trying to accomplish, my workflow was just different and a little more disorganized. My PT is not as orderly as the workflow his gem 
tries to enforce (maybe it should be). But whatever the case, I am a fan of [GitPivotal][1] and I tried to show that by making a better version here using
some of the ideas found there. No hate :)
